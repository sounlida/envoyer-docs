## Updating Your Profile Information

You may update your name, email and password from the [Account dashboard](https://envoyer.io/user/profile#/account) within your user profile at any time.

## Securing Your Account With Two Factor Authentication

You can add Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to your account from the [Account page](https://envoyer.io/user/profile#/account). Once you enable 2FA, please remember to scan the 2FA barcode into your phone's authentication application.

:::tip Using 2FA
We recommend using the [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447) application on your smartphone to manage your Envoyer 2FA configuration.

## Billing

You can sign up to any one of Envoyer's three subscription plans:

- **Basic** - 10 Projects, 10 Minute Deploy Time
- **Plus** - 20 Projects, 10 Minute Deploy Time
- **Premium** - Unlimited Projects, 15 Minute Deploy Time

You may join Envoyer for free as a collaborator on other projects. If you need to manage your own projects in the future, you can upgrade your account at any time.

:::tip Maximum Deploy Time

The build time for each plan determines the maximum that your deployment plan can take before timing out.

### Business Receipts

If you need to add specific contact or tax information to your receipts, like your full business name, VAT identification number, or address of record you can add Extra Billing Information from the Subscription page in your account. We'll make sure it shows up on every receipt.

### Deleting Your Account

:::danger Account Data
